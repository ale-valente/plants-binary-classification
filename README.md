# Deep Learning Neural Network: Plants Binary Classification [Python]
Deep Learning Neural Network: Plants Binary Classification written in Python using Google Colab IDE (or Jupyter Notebook). I've used a deep neural network (CNN + GAP + DENSE Perceptron Layers) to classify plants RGB images (3x96x96) in a binary problem: health plants or not.

Data is not available here on Github (too large file for this platform). The data contains 5200 RGB images that are stored in a Numpy array file (data.npz) with the shape of 5200x96x96x3.
